# Representing a school's week calendar using HTML tables and inline CSS

this is just a simple test for an assignment

## How to test the HTML page?

simply open your browser pointing to the index.html file or open a quick server using [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) (recommended by me) on VSCode, you can even upload it on a real web server to test it.
